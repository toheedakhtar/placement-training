OBSERVATION

Body language

- Non verbal - Signs of consciousness 
    70% communincation is through non verbal
    HR's eye will be completley focused on how someone displays their body language.

    Not good Voice clarity -> shows lack of confidence, 

When askes about journey.
    ignite emotions, overcoming challenges basically manipulating/persuading by giving answers with some soul.
    refrain from redundancy.

bad things- 
    not being acceptive? 
    not confident, 
    no eye contact, 
    dont be defensive. be assertive,
    face towards the interviewer / person who are talking to you.
    dont't be unsure,

    body language, posture improper, are bad things,
    dont close your body, use gestures,

    dont just hear, listen to the words, pay attention, be attentive.
    no excuses,
    

G-2 
    dont hesitate
    be clear, have some clarity.
    losing eye contact might be a sign of defeat,
    checking leadership which is if you can break the other preson's shell and made him/her do what he/she is afraid of.

    cereberum, cogintive process.


communication is not about language, it is about striking the chords?
